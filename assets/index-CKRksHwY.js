Demons with hellfire swords. The apocalyptic showdown to end all showdowns. The very air crackled with dramatic tension - the kind that made even the weather hold its breath.\n\nAnd then he arrived.\n\nNot with a bang.\n\nNot with a whisper.\n\nBut with a BOOM-SHAKA-LAKA that made the ground do the Macarena.\n\nOne moment, the forces of Heaven and Hell were locked in their final, glorious battle cry-\n\n-the next, a neon pink parachute emblazoned with "Y\'ALL NEED THERAPY" billowed open over the battlefield, and he came sliding down the strings like a drunk spider on a sugar rush.\n\n"HOLD THE PHONE!" he screamed, landing crotch-first on the head of a very unfortunate demon lieutenant. "Before we get to all the stabby-stabby, fiery-fiery nonsense - " He sprang up, producing a comically oversized boombox from somewhere. " - have you heard this classic?"\n\nHe hit play.\n\nThe opening synth of Never Gonna Give You Up blared across the battlefield at ear-bleeding volume.\n\nThe effect was instant.\n\nAngels dropped their halberds to clutch their ears. Demons screamed in unholy anguish. A particularly sensitive cherub burst into tears.\n\n"DANCE BREAK!" he howled, already doing the robot with alarming flexibility.\n\nAnd then - because why wouldn\'t he - he backflipped onto the back of the Archangel Michael, grabbed his wings like handlebars, and yelled, "GIDDYUP, HOLY HORSEY!"\n\nMichael made a noise no celestial being should ever make.\n\nMeanwhile, in Hell\'s Front Row:\n\nSatan facepalmed so hard his horns got stuck. "We trained for millennia for this?"\n\nThe Punchline:\n\nAs the chorus hit, he produced THE FINAL LAUGH - his gilded, chaos-infused firework cannon (name WIP) - and fired it directly upward.\n\nThe explosion wasn’t just light and sound.\n\nIt was a mile-wide, high-definition Rick Astley head that winked and sang along in perfect sync.\n\nThe battlefield erupted - not in war, but in the most forced, chaotic dance number in cosmic history. Demons and angels alike found their limbs moving against their will, caught in the cursed groove.\n\n"BEHOLD!" he cackled, surfacing from a conga line of bewildered seraphim. "THE TRUE POWER OF DIPLOMACY!"\n\nThen - just as suddenly as he arrived - he grabbed a nearby demon and angel by the scruffs of their necks, forced them into an awkward waltz, and vanished in a puff of glitter that spelled out "CALL ME MAYBE."\n\nAftermath:\n\n* The River Styx now plays elevator music.\n\n* The Pearly Gates have a "No Rickrolling" sign (it doesn’t work).\n\n* Every time an angel says "Holy," a demon instinctively replies "...Guacamole."\n\nAnd somewhere, he is already reloading THE FINAL LAUGH, grinning like a man who just replaced the Holy Grail with a whoopee cup.'},{id:"2",title:"AND GOD SAID: YO MAMA SO FAT...",excerpt:"Sacred tablets get the roast they deserved",color:"from-purple-500 to-indigo-600",tags:["Sacrilegious","Mischief"],content:'# AND GOD SAID: \'YO MAMA SO FAT...\'\n\nThe sacred mountain trembled as the last of the smoke cleared. Moses stood blinking at the stone tablets in his hands - or rather, what was left of them.\n\nThe original Ten Commandments had been carefully carved by the finger of God Himself.\n\nNow, they read (terribly sorry for this being cringe and gen alpha but i love it LMAO):\n\n* YO MAMA SO OLD, SHE KNEW THE EARTH WHEN IT WAS STILL IN BETA\n\n* THOU SHALT NOT DISRESPECT THE GRIND (UNLESS IT’S A LITERAL GRINDSTONE, THEN GO WILD)\n\n* REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY - BECAUSE YO MAMA SURE FORGOT HER GYM MEMBERSHIP\n\n* HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER (ESPECIALLY SINCE YO MAMA CARRIED YOU FOR NINE MONTHS AND ALL YOU DO IS SASS)\n\n* THOU SHALT NOT STEAL (UNLESS IT’S A KISS FROM YO MAMA, SHE’S A SNACK)\n\n* THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS (UNLESS YO MAMA ASKS IF HER HAIR LOOKS GOOD, THEN LIE)\n\n* THOU SHALT NOT ADMIT THAT YO MAMA JOKES GOT YOU THIS FAR IN THE LIST\n\n* THOU SHALT NOT MAKE GRAVEN IMAGES (UNLESS IT’S A STATUE OF YO MAMA’S LEGENDARY MAC & CHEESE)\n\n* THOU SHALT NOT COVET (BUT LET’S BE REAL, YO MAMA’S COOKING IS WORTH IT)\n\n* THOU SHALT LAUGH AT THIS OR BE SMITED WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE\n\nMoses’ beard turned white. Then blue. Then a shade of purple that technically didn’t exist yet.\n\n"WHAT IN THE NAME OF-"\n\n"SURPRIIIIISE!"\n\nA firework shaped like a laughing emoji detonated overhead, and he rappelled down from the heavens using the Burning Bush as a makeshift rope.\n\n"Mood kind of died after the first three, so I spiced it up," he said, dusting off his sleeves - which were now inexplicably made of the fabric of reality itself. "What do you think? I was gonna go with knock-knock jokes, but then I remembered - " He leaned in. "-yo mama."\n\nThe ground rumbled. The clouds parted. A voice like thunder boomed:\n\n"WHO DARES DEFACE MY DIVINE LAWS?"\n\n"Oh hey, Big G!" He waved at the sky like it was an old pal. "Love the whole ‘smiting’ aesthetic, but let’s be real - " He gestured to the crowd of Israelites, who were already snickering. " - this is way funnier."\n\nGod’s silence was palpable.\n\nThen - BOOM - THE FINAL LAUGH fired again, and the mountain exploded into a disco ball.\n\nMoses dropped the tablets. They shattered.\n\n"WHOPS!" He gasped, clutching his cheeks in mock horror. "Guess you’ll just have to improvise."\n\nAnd with that, he backflipped into a conveniently placed tornado, cackling as the Israelites burst into spontaneous yo mama battles.\n\nAnd somewhere beyond space and time, he is already rewriting the Quran as a series of TikTok dances.'},{id:"3",title:"STAR WRECK",excerpt:"Imperial decorum meets glittery anarchy",color:"from-cyan-500 to-blue-600",tags:["Parody","Disco Death Star","Chaos"],content:'# STAR WRECK\n\nThe Death Star\'s command bridge was dead silent as the Rebel fleet massed outside the viewports. Darth Vader\'s respirator echoed through the tension-filled air as he clenched his fist. "The time has come. Prepare to fire the superlas-"\n\nFWOOOMP-SPLORCH!\n\nA giant inflatable duck the size of a TIE fighter suddenly materialized in the middle of the bridge, bouncing off consoles and sending stormtroopers scrambling. Before anyone could react, a figure in a bedazzled stormtrooper helmet came sliding down the duck\'s neck, whooping as he crashed into the navigation panel.\n\n"WHAT THE - "\n\n"GOOOOOOD MORNING, SPACE NAZIS!" The intruder sprang to his feet, his cape (made entirely of stitched-together Wookiee fur socks) flaring dramatically. He yanked off the helmet to reveal a grinning madman with one side of his face painted like a My Little Pony. "Hope you don\'t mind me dropping in! I brought snacks!"\n\nHe tossed something at Vader, who instinctively Force-caught it - only to realize it was a whoopee cushion that immediately deflated with a wet pffffbt noise. The Dark Lord\'s gloves creaked as his fists clenched.\n\n"You..."\n\n"Me!" The stranger spun in a circle, nearly elbowing a terrified officer in the face. "And you! And - oh wow, is that Boba Fett back there? Buddy! You gotta lose the helmet, it\'s cramping your style!"\n\nBefore anyone could react, he\'d somehow crossed the bridge in two bounds and was enthusiastically ruffling the bounty hunter\'s helmet like an annoying uncle. Fett reached for his blaster - only to find it had been replaced with a banana.\n\nThe stranger gasped. "Oh no! Did I do that? Whoopsie!"\n\nVader ignited his lightsaber with a deadly snap-hiss - or tried to. Instead of the familiar crimson blade, a floppy neon pool noodle extended from the hilt, flopping limply against his boot.\n\nThe bridge went silent.\n\nThe stranger clutched his stomach, howling with laughter. "Oh man! The look on your face! Classic!" He pulled out a comically oversized remote and pressed a button.\n\nEvery single stormtrooper\'s helmet speakers suddenly blasted Never Gonna Give You Up at maximum volume.\n\nAs the white-armored soldiers began awkwardly shuffling to the beat, the stranger backflipped onto the main console. "Alright kids, time for today\'s lesson: Why fascism is super lame!" He kicked the superlaser controls - which somehow turned the planet-destroying weapon into a giant disco ball that began playing ABBA.\n\nSomewhere in the chaos, Admiral Piett quietly accepted his fate and started doing the Macarena.\n\nWhen the Emperor arrived via hologram, furious yellow eyes scanning the carnage, the stranger just waved. "Hey Sparky! Love what you\'ve done with the place! Very... black and murdery." He leaned closer to the flickering image. "Quick question - does your mom know you dress like that?"\n\nThe ensuing Force lightning missed entirely, instead hitting a console that launched all the TIE fighters - which had inexplicably been replaced with flying toasters.\n\nAs alarms blared and the Death Star began listing drunkenly to one side, the stranger tipped his hat to the camera (there wasn\'t a camera) and vanished in a puff of glitter that spelled out "YOLO."\n\nThe last thing Vader heard as the station careened toward Endor\'s moon was distant, gleeful laughter - and the distinct sound of a kazoo.'},{id:"4",title:"THE END OF THE WORLD",excerpt:"Apocalypse canceled due to bad punchlines",color:"from-green-500 to-emerald-600",tags:["Una Divina Battuta","Sacrilegious","Chaos"],content:'# THE END OF THE WORLD\n\nThe apocalypse was supposed to be a solemn affair. The skies had darkened to the color of a fresh bruise, the seas had turned to blood, and the Four Horsemen had assembled at the edge of oblivion, looking appropriately grim. Death adjusted his scythe. War polished his sword. Famine checked his watch. Pestilence sneezed into his sleeve.\n\nThen the heavens split open with the sound of a kazoo being played directly into God’s ear.\n\n"GOOD EVENING, DOOMED POPULACE!"\n\nA figure in a sequined hazmat suit descended from the crack in reality, riding a neon-pink comet that smelled vaguely of cotton candy and bad decisions. He landed - knees first - on Death’s horse, sending the skeletal steed into a panic. The horse bucked, throwing Death into Famine, who stumbled into War, who accidentally stabbed Pestilence in the foot.\n\n"Whoops!" The intruder grinned, adjusting his cracked opera mask, which now had a crude mustache drawn on it in permanent marker. "My bad!"\n\nDeath yanked his scythe free from where it had gotten stuck in a nearby cloud. "You."\n\n"Me!" He spun in a circle, arms outstretched, nearly clotheslining War with a glowstick necklace. "And you! And you! And - " He paused, squinting at the fourth Horseman. "Wait. Who are you?"\n\nThe fourth figure adjusted his tie. "Inflation."\n\n"Ohhhh, right, right," he said, nodding sagely. "Classic Horseman career change. So, what’s the plan here? Fire? Brimstone? A really stern memo?"\n\n"THE END OF ALL THINGS," Death intoned.\n\n"Boring!" He whipped out THE FINAL LAUGH, his gilded firework cannon, and fired it directly into the sky. The explosion wasn’t just light and sound - it was a message. A mile-wide, shimmering projection of God’s face, but with a clown nose and the caption:\n\n"CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE (AND THIS MESS)"\n\nThe heavens rumbled. The clouds parted. A voice like thunder boomed:\n\n"**WHO DARES?**"\n\n"Oh hey, Big G!" He waved cheerfully. "Love the whole ‘end times’ aesthetic, but let’s be real - " He gestured to the Horsemen, who were now tangled in a knot of limbs and spectral reins. " - this is way funnier."\n\n**P.S. I know that its repetition, this is a proof of concept so i dont care that i repeat myself**\n\nThe silence that followed was so thick even the damned stopped screaming to listen.\n\nThen - somewhere in the back - a single, nervous chuckle escaped from a cherub.\n\nThat was all it took.\n\nThe apocalypse unraveled.\n\nWar dropped his sword to facepalm. Famine started stress-eating his own horse’s spectral oats. Pestilence pulled out a handheld fan and started dramatically fanning himself. Death just sat down on a nearby rock and put his skull in his hands.\n\nAnd he?\n\nHe strolled over to the Antichrist - a beleaguered office worker named Greg who had been dragged into this against his will - and plopped down on the Throne of Bones next to him.\n\n"So," he said, throwing an arm around Greg’s shoulders. "You come here often?"\n\nGreg groaned. "I just wanted to file my taxes."\n\n"Mood." He snapped his fingers, and the Throne of Bones transformed into a La-Z-Boy recliner. "Hey, you wanna see something funny?"\n\nBefore Greg could answer, he fired THE FINAL LAUGH again - this time straight into the Lake of Fire. The flames sputtered, coughed, and then turned into a lazy river filled with inflatable flamingos. The screams of the damned shifted seamlessly into "Baby Shark."\n\nSatan, who had been mid-snack on a damned soul, paused. "...Huh."\n\nAnd just like that - the apocalypse fizzled.\n\nThe skies lightened. The seas turned back to water, though now with a slight lemon scent. The Horsemen collectively decided to take a personal day.\n\nAnd as the last echoes of divine wrath faded into awkward silence, he stood up, stretched, and tipped his hat to the heavens.\n\n"Same time next millennium?"\n\nThen - with a wink - he vanished in a puff of glitter that spelled out "CALL ME."'}],l=({story:t,onClick:n})=>e.jsxs("div",{onClick:n,className:"group relative w-screen h-screen flex-shrink-0 bg-gray-800 overflow-hidden cursor-pointer transform transition-all duration-500 hover:scale-[1.02]",style:{background:"linear-gradient(90deg, \n                    rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.8) 0%, \n                    rgb(31, 41, 55) 5%, \n                    rgb(31, 41, 55) 95%, \n                    rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.8) 100%)"},children:[e.jsx("div",{className:`absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br ${t.color} opacity-30 group-hover:opacity-40 transition-opacity duration-500`}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"absolute inset-0 opacity-5",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute top-1/4 left-1/4 w-96 h-96 rounded-full bg-white blur-3xl animate-pulse-slow"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute bottom-1/4 right-1/4 w-80 h-80 rounded-full bg-white blur-3xl animate-float"})]}),e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute top-20 right-20 w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 to-violet-500 animate-pulse-slow opacity-60"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute bottom-32 left-20 w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-400 to-blue-500 animate-float opacity-70"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute top-1/2 right-1/3 w-4 h-4 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-orange-500 animate-pulse opacity-50"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute top-1/3 left-1/2 w-5 h-5 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-emerald-500 animate-float opacity-60",style:{animationDelay:"2s"}}),e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute top-8 right-8 px-4 py-2 bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full border border-white/20",children:e.jsxs("span",{className:"text-white/80 text-sm font-medium",children:["Episode ",t.id]})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"relative h-full flex items-center justify-center p-16",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"text-center max-w-4xl",children:[e.jsx("h3",{className:"text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-6 group-hover:text-transparent group-hover:bg-clip-text group-hover:bg-gradient-to-r group-hover:from-white group-hover:to-gray-300 transition-all duration-500 leading-tight",children:t.title}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-gray-200 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto",children:t.excerpt}),e.jsx("div",{className:"flex flex-wrap gap-3 justify-center mb-8",children:t.tags.map((t,n)=>e.jsx("span",{className:"px-4 py-2 text-sm bg-white/10 text-white rounded-full border border-white/20 backdrop-blur-sm group-hover:bg-white/20 group-hover:border-white/30 transition-all duration-300",children:t},n))}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"opacity-60 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-300",children:[e.jsx("p",{className:"text-white/80 text-base",children:"Click to read the story"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"mt-3 w-10 h-10 mx-auto border-2 border-white/40 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center animate-pulse",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"w-0 h-0 border-l-4 border-l-white/60 border-t-2 border-t-transparent border-b-2 border-b-transparent ml-1"})})]})]})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-black/30 via-transparent to-black/20 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-500"})]});
