# The Final Laugh

The world was a stage, and he was the only one who knew the script.

Or, more accurately, he was the one who ***burned*** the script.

A whisper of wind curled through the empty streets of a city that had, moments ago, been bustling with life. Now, it was silent - unnervingly so. The lamplights flickered, their glow dimming as if afraid to illuminate what came next. Then, from the shadows of an alleyway, a figure stepped forward, his grin cutting through the darkness like a knife.

He wore a long, tattered coat that seemed to shift colors in the dim light - sometimes crimson, sometimes violet, sometimes no color at all. His hair was wild, unruly, as if it refused to obey the laws of gravity any more than he did. And in his hands, resting lazily against his shoulder, was a massive, ornate launcher, its barrel shaped like a grinning jester’s mouth.

THE FINAL LAUGH.

His name didn’t matter. Titles didn’t either. He was the one who played while others toiled, the one who laughed while the world wept. And tonight? Tonight, he was bored.

With a dramatic sigh, he spun on his heel, the coat flaring behind him like the wings of some great, mischievous bird. "Well, this is dull," he mused, tapping a finger against his chin. "A whole city, full of rules, full of order… *How tedious.*"

A snap of his fingers.

The world *rippled.*

Time stuttered. The air itself seemed to hesitate, unsure whether to obey physics or his whims. And then-

***BOOM.***

Fireworks erupted in the sky, not from above, but from inside buildings, from beneath cobblestones, from the pockets of startled pigeons. The blasts painted the night in impossible colors - neon greens, liquid gold, a shade of pink that didn’t exist in nature. The city’s inhabitants, who had been hiding in fear moments before, now stumbled into the streets, gaping at the spectacle.

And he?

He was already gone.

Only two things remained in his wake: the echoes of manic laughter, drifting on the wind like a half-remembered dream, and a single white flower resting on the ground - pristine, untouched by the chaos around it.

A signature.

A joke.

A promise.

Because he was never truly gone.

He was simply waiting for the next act to begin.

And oh, what a *delightful* performance it would be.

# The Jester's Gate

## Chapter 1: A Storm of Swords

The siege of Eldermere had lasted three bloody weeks.

The walls trembled under the relentless assault of the Black Horde, their twisted siege engines hurling fire and death. King Aldric stood atop the battlements, his armor dented, his sword slick with gore. Behind him, the last of his knights formed a desperate line. Before him, the enemy’s war drums thundered like the heartbeat of a dying world.

“Stand fast!” the king roared, raising his blade. “For honor! For Eldermere!”

His men echoed the cry, their voices raw with exhaustion. The air reeked of smoke and iron. The sky, choked with ash, wept embers instead of rain.

This was the end. A noble last stand. A tale for the bards - if any survived to sing it.

And then…

FWEEEEEEEE-

A sound cut through the din of war. High-pitched. Whistling. Unnatural.

Every head - knight, orc, even the damned siege beasts - turned skyward.

A single firework streaked up from somewhere within the castle, spiraling in impossible loops before exploding in a burst of neon-green sparks. The explosion formed a grinning face in the sky, winking down at the battlefield.

Silence.

Then - laughter.

Not the hearty chuckle of a victorious warrior. Not the nervous giggle of a dying man.

This was the sound of pure, unfiltered madness.

A figure stood atop the highest tower, where no man could have climbed. His coat flapped in a wind that didn’t exist. His hair defied gravity, his grin defied sense. And in his hands?

THE FINAL LAUGH.

“Oh, dear,” he sighed, shaking his head. “All this drama. All this stabbing. Where’s the fun in that?”

The king gaped. “Who - what - ?”

The Jester twirled his launcher like a baton. “Let’s fix this, shall we?”

He pulled the trigger.

## Chapter 2: The Rules Are Dead (And So Is Common Sense)

The firework hit the battlefield.

Then everything went wrong.

The ground turned to gelatin. Knights and orcs alike sank up to their knees in quivering, rainbow-hued earth.

The sky rained pies. Not metaphorical pies. Actual, cream-filled, crusty projectiles. One smothered an ogre mid-roar.

The castle’s gargoyles came to life. And started tap-dancing.

A random chicken gained the power of speech. It immediately declared itself the new king.

Time hiccuped. Now the siege had always been a bake-off. No, a poetry slam. No, a nude poetry slam-

“STOP THIS!” bellowed King Aldric, now waist-deep in sentient pudding.

The Jester gasped, clutching his chest. “Stop? Oh, you poor, serious thing. Don’t you see?” He spread his arms wide. “This is better!”

A knight tried to stab him. The blade passed through his chest - and came out holding a bouquet of daisies.

The Jester plucked one, sniffed it, then tossed it aside. “Boring. Let’s try again.”

Another firework.

## Chapter 3: The Fourth Wall? What Fourth Wall?

Now the narrative itself buckled.

The prose switched to iambic pentameter. Then to emojis. Then to a grocery list.

Characters gained awareness. A foot soldier turned to the reader and screamed, “HELP ME.”

The Jester started editing the text. Scribbling in margins that didn’t exist.

The king’s tragic backstory was retconned into a comedy. His beloved, dead queen? Actually just really good at hide-and-seek.

“WHAT ARE YOU?!” Aldric howled, now wearing a clown nose that hadn’t been there a second ago.

The Jester tilted his head. “Me? Oh, I’m the punchline.” He leaned in, whispering like a secret: “And the joke’s on you.”

He snapped his fingers.

The world reset.

The siege was back. The king stood on the walls. The Horde charged.

But now, in every soldier’s hand?

A single white flower.

And from somewhere, nowhere, everywhere - laughter.

# La Divina Commedia

## Chapter 1: The Church That Lost Its Mind

Reverend Michaels had never seen a Bible spontaneously combust into a cloud of glitter before.

But there it was - his leather-bound King James Version, now a pile of ash and sparkles, swirling into the shape of a middle finger before dissipating.

The congregation gasped. The choir dropped their hymnals. The old lady in the front pew clutched her pearls so hard they turned into dice.

And then - laughter.

Not holy laughter. Not polite church giggles.

This was the sound of a godless entity who just chugged a six-pack of chaos.

The Jester swung down from the chandelier (which was now inexplicably shaped like a yo-yo), landing on the pulpit with a squish - because the floor had turned to Jell-O.

"Alright, folks!" he announced, spinning his firework launcher like a baton. "Let’s talk about sin - or, as I like to call it, Tuesday."

He snapped his fingers.

The Ten Commandments on the wall exploded, the stone shattering like cheap drywall before reassembling into neon graffiti.

The crowd read them.

They screamed.

## Chapter 2: The Yo-Ma-Mandments

* "Thou shalt have no other gods before Me… because yo’ mama so holy, she makes Me look like a temp worker."

* "No graven images? Yo mama so ugly, even stick figures ask her to put a bag over her head."

* "Take My name in vain? Yo mama named you Tyler. Who’s really blaspheming here?"

* "Keep the Sabbath holy? Yo mama so lazy, she thinks ‘Sabbath’ is a naptime suggestion."

* "Honor thy father and mother? Yo mama so old, she changed Moses’ diapers."

* "Murder’s bad? Yo mama so violent, she roundhouse kicked the forbidden fruit outta Eve’s hand."

* "Adultery? Yo mama so scandalous, the Twelve Apostles had a group chat about her."

* "Stealing? Yo mama so broke, she pawned the Ark of the Covenant for gas money."

* "False witness? Yo mama lie so much, her Ten Commandments come with a terms-and-conditions disclaimer."

* "Coveting? Yo mama so greedy, she tried to baptize herself in a bank vault."

Silence.

Then-

"OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!" roared the entire congregation, pointing at each other like a live studio audience of The Jerry Springer Show.

The Jester wiped away a tear. "*Beautiful.*"

## Chapter 3: The Holy Roast

What happened next defied the laws of God, man, and basic cable:

* The crucifix sprouted arms and started clapping.

* The organ played Never Gonna Give You Up.

* The collection plates filled with Monopoly money.

* The reverend’s robes turned into a cheetah-print onesie.

* A random toddler stood up and yelled, "GOT ‘EM!"

"ENOUGH!" roared Reverend Michaels, now holding a water gun full of holy sriracha. "This is a house of God!"

The Jester gasped. "House of God? Buddy, this is a roast battle now." He raised his firework launcher. "And guess what?"

BOOM.

The stained-glass windows exploded outward, revealing a sky now filled with giant, floating Yo Mama jokes written in Comic Sans.

The Jester took a bow.

Then-

Poof.

Gone.

Only three things remained:

* Every Bible in the church now had a "Yo Mama" joke scribbled in the margins.

* The reverend’s voice was permanently stuck in a squeaky toy register.

* A single white flower on the altar.

And somewhere, in the distance… laughter.

*The next Sunday, attendance was at an all-time high. Turns out, people love holy roasts.*

# Eclipsing Elation

## Chapter 1: The Fool Who Out-Fooled the Fools

The Masked Fools were in the middle of another grand, theatrical scheme - when reality itself hiccuped.

A firework the size of a small moon burst over their hideout, showering them in neon sparks that spelled out:

"Y’ALL SUCK AT COMEDY."

The Fools froze.

Sampo Koski, mid-scheme, dropped his fake mustache. Sparkle’s grin twitched. Even Aha, the Aeon of Elation, paused in the middle of rewriting destiny just to stare.

And then - laughter.

Not the usual manic, scripted laughter of the Fools. This was raw, unfiltered, unhinged mirth, the kind that made planets reconsider their life choices.

A figure cartwheeled out of thin air, landing atop a floating grand piano that hadn’t been there a second ago. His coat flapped in a nonexistent wind, his grin sharp enough to cut through the fourth wall.

The Jester had arrived.

And he was disappointed.

## Chapter 2: "Your Comedy is Mid (And So Is Your God)"

The Jester sighed, shaking his head like a disappointed teacher.

"Okay, let’s review," he said, pacing on the piano (which was now playing Yakety Sax on loop). "You call yourselves Fools? You worship Elation? And yet - " He gestured at them. "This is the best you’ve got? Pranks? Mischief? Boring."

Sparkle’s eye twitched. "Excuse me - "

The Jester snapped his fingers.

Sparkle’s mask turned into a sock puppet.

"YOU WERE SAYING?" the sock puppet yelled.

Sampo took a step back. "Okay, new rule: Nobody touches the masks - "

FWOOMPH.

Sampo’s voice was now auto-tuned to sound like a chipmunk on helium.

The Jester clapped. "Better! Now, where’s your so-called ‘god’? I wanna have a chat."

As if on cue, **THEY** gazed upon the jester. **THEIR** masks no longer smiling, but confused. For the first time, **THEY** seized their laugh to grant an uninvited guest an audience with **THEM**, in a place where all paths converged.

Aha: "WHO DARES - "

The Jester: "Dares? Buddy, I invented daring. Also, your whole ‘Elation’ schtick? Weak. Let me show you how it’s really done."

He raised THE FINAL LAUGH and fired.

## Chapter 3: The Aeon of Elation Gets Roasted

The firework hit Aha dead center, and suddenly-

The universe got a laugh track.

Aha’s masks grew clown noses.

The concept of "pranks" was legally redefined as "whatever The Jester says it is."

The Jester grinned. "See? Now we’re having fun."

Aha, for the first time in eternity, was speechless.

The Masked Fools? They were losing it.

* Sparkle was stuck in a sitcom laugh loop.

* Sampo was trying (and failing) to sell The Jester fake insurance.

* The other Fools were reduced to background extras in their own story.

The Jester spun on his heel, addressing the cosmos like a stand-up comedian closing a set.

"Ladies, gentlemen, and eldritch horrors - you’ve been great! But let’s be real: I just out-clowned your clown god. So, in honor of my victory - "

He snapped his fingers one last time.

Every member of the Masked Fools glitched into mimes.

Aha’s mask turned into a "Kick Me" sign.

And The Jester?

He was already gone.

Only three things remained:

* A single white flower floating in zero gravity.

* The faint sound of distant laughter.

* A new universal law: "The Jester is now the funniest thing in existence. Sorry, Aha."

# After Being Hit by Truck-Kun, I Was Summoned as the ‘Hero’ But Decided to Break the RPG System and Troll the God Who Reincarnated Me Because Rules Are for Losers

## Chapter 1: Truck-Kun’s Greatest Mistake

The Jester was mid-prank - replacing all the traffic lights with clown faces - when it happened.

HONK. SCREECH. THUD.

Truck-kun had struck.

As his body ragdolled through the air, The Jester had only one thought:

"*Wow. How cliché.*"

Then - darkness.

## Chapter 2: "God’s Worst Decision"

He awoke in a void of shimmering nonsense, face-to-face with a magnificent, radiant being - "the God of This World"™, complete with flowing robes, glowing eyes, and a tragic backstory.

"O Chosen One™!" the god boomed. "You have died in your world, but I grant you a second chance! You must - "

The Jester yawned so hard his jaw cracked.

"Let me guess," he interrupted. "Demon Lord, RPG powers, harem potential? *Yawn*."

The god faltered. "I - well - yes, but-"

The Jester leaned in. "What if I said... no?"

"You can’t say no!"

"Watch me."

He backflipped out of the void, crashing into the new world before the god could finish his exposition.

## Chapter 3: "Tutorial NPC Meets Agent of Chaos"

The Jester woke up in a field of suspiciously peaceful flowers, far from any kingdom, dungeon, or plot relevance.

A soft voice gasped. "Oh! You’re awake!"

Standing over him was Lumina, the Beautiful Elf Tutorial NPC™ - golden hair, sparkling eyes, and a 100% guaranteed Tragic Backstory™.

"Thank the gods! You must be the Hero!" she said, clasping her hands. "I’ll guide you to-"

The Jester poked her forehead.

"Nope."

"W-what?"

"I don’t do ‘quests.’ Or ‘destiny.’ Or basic storytelling." He grinned. "But I do do pranks."

He snapped his fingers.

## Chapter 4: "The RPG System Wishes It Was Dead"

A blue screen appeared - the Sacred Status Window™.

NAME: [ERROR]
CLASS: [ERROR]
LEVEL: [NOPE]
SKILLS: [CHAOS PRIMORDIAL]

Lumina stared. "That’s... not supposed to happen."

The Jester tapped the screen. It squeaked like a dog toy.

"Hmm. Needs more spice."

He typed directly into the system:

"Gravity? Optional."

"NPCs now have free will (and existential dread)."

"All damage is replaced with dubstep sounds."

The world glitched.

Lumina’s face pixelated. "WHAT DID YOU DO?!"

The Jester spun in midair, now immune to physics. "Improved it."

## Chapter 5: "The Dark Lord Gets Trolled"

Meanwhile, in his Sinister Dark Castle™, the Demon Lord™ felt a chill.

His generals trembled. "My lord! The Hero comes!"

The doors exploded - not with force, but with a confetti cannon.

The Jester strolled in, eating an enchanted apple he’d turned into a whoopee cushion.

"So. You’re the final boss?" He smirked. "Cute."

The Demon Lord summoned his Ultimate Dark Magic™-

-only for The Jester to replace his spellbook with a coloring book.

"Let’s elevate this fight." He raised THE FINAL LAUGH. "How about a dance-off?"

The Dark Lord had never known fear until now.

## Aftermath

*And so, the world’s greatest isekai adventure ended... before it even began. Somewhere, a god wept. Lumina opened a tavern. And Truck-kun? He retired.*

# The Jester Discovers TikTok. The Universe Weeps

## Chapter 1: "The Algorithm Never Saw Him Coming"

The Jester was bored.

Again.

He had already replaced all the world’s traffic lights with his own face, turned the moon into a disco ball, and convinced several world leaders that they were actually muppets.

But then - he found it.

A glowing rectangle. A cursed app. A digital playground of chaos.

TikTok.

His grin split his face like a fracture in reality.

"Oh," he whispered. "This is going to be fun."

## Chapter 2: "Going Viral (Literally)"

His first video was simple:

* Him staring directly into the camera.

* Five seconds of silence.

* Then, the entire frame glitched into a screaming goat.

10 million views in an hour.

His second video?

* A "life hack" where he replaced all water in the world with sparkling grape juice.

Governments collapsed.

His third video?

* A dance trend where every participant exploded into confetti upon completion.

The death toll was *hilarious*.

## Chapter 3: "The Rise of @TheJesterOfficial"

Followers: Every living being in the universe (mandatory).

Bio: "Professional Menace. God of Pranks. Your Worst Algorithm."

Most Liked Comment: "WHAT IS HAPPENING"  - @God.

His content escalated:

* "POV: You’re a NPC realizing you’re in a simulation." (All NPCs gained sentience.)

* "Try not to laugh challenge" (Everyone who failed ***actually died laughing.***)

* "Rating your OC’s" (He turned them all into sock puppets.)

## Chapter 4: "TikTok’s Final Boss"'

The app’s AI, a fragile digital bureaucrat, tried to ban him.

Big mistake.

* Every "ban" notification was replaced with Rick Astley.

* The "Report" button just sent users a picture of The Jester winking.

* The CEO woke up to find his bank account replaced with Monopoly money.

The Jester’s response video?

* "TikTok, you’re adorable." (The app’s logo turned into a crying emoji.)

## Chapter 5: "The Universe’s Last Tweet"

As reality itself began to buffer, the last coherent message from the cosmos was:

"We regret to inform you that The Jester has achieved ultimate influencer status. Please remain calm. Or don’t. It won’t help."

Then - silence.

Except for one notification:

> @TheJesterOfficial posted a new video!

"POV: You’re the last surviving organism in existence. Smash like and subscribe."

# The Jester Takes a Day Off

## Chapter 1: The Unthinkable Happens

The cosmos held its breath.

The Jester - the living embodiment of chaos, the prankster of reality, the entity who once turned gravity into a suggestion - had done something unprecedented.

He took a **day off**.

No fireworks. No interdimensional shenanigans. No rewriting the laws of physics for fun.

Just… silence.

The universe did not know how to process this.

## Chapter 2: Panic Ensues

* Gods checked their divine inboxes. No memes. No taunts. No ransom notes written in glitter.

* Scientists wept. The speed of light had returned to normal, and they were bored.

* Demons in Hell held an emergency meeting. "Is this a trick? IT’S A TRICK, RIGHT?"

* The fourth wall itself started cracking from the lack of abuse.

A lone philosopher stared into the void and whispered: "*What does it MEAN?*"

The void did not answer.

## Chapter 3: The Universe Without Chaos (A Tragedy)

* Prank victims wandered the streets, lost. "Who will fill my shoes with bees now?"

* The concept of irony collapsed. Sarcasm became literal. It was awful.

* TikTok was… normal. (The true horror.)

* The laws of physics tried to reassert themselves, but they were rusty. (Gravity kept hiccuping.)

Even Aha, the Aeon of Elation, sat in a corner, rocking back and forth. "He’s planning something. He HAS to be."

## Chapter 4: The Truth Revealed

Meanwhile, in a dimension made entirely of **cozy blankets and infinite snacks**, The Jester lounged in a hammock, sipping a drink with a tiny umbrella.

A nervous minion (who had been forced into existence just for this moment) approached.

"*Uh, boss? Reality is, like… falling apart out there.*"

The Jester took a slow sip. "*And?*"

"*People are losing their MINDS!*"

"*Good.*" He adjusted his sunglasses. "*Let them sweat.*"

## Chapter 5: The Aftermath

By the time The Jester finally returned to work (24 hours later), the universe was a broken, twitching mess.

* Time had started running backward in some places.

* Birds had forgotten how to fly.

* At least three new religions had formed in his absence.

He stretched, cracked his knuckles, and grinned.

"Miss me?"

Then he replaced the sun with a giant whoopee cushion, and everything was right again.

*Somewhere, a single white flower bloomed. It was middle-fingering the sky.*

# The Jester vs. The Shipping Fandom

## Chapter 1: The Jester Discovers Fanfiction

The Jester was bored.

Again.

He had already replaced all the world’s coffee with decaf, turned the moon into a disco ball, and convinced several world leaders that they were actually sock puppets.

But then - he found it.

A glowing screen. A cursed website. A digital playground of unhinged imagination.

Archive of Our Own.

His grin split his face like a fracture in reality.

"Oh," he whispered. "This is going to be fun."

## Chapter 2: "Let’s Make Every Ship Canon"

His first move was simple:

* He clicked the "All Ships" tag.

* He snapped his fingers.

* Reality glitched.

Suddenly:

* Enemies-to-lovers? Now legally binding. (Two rival kings woke up married. Neither was happy.)

* Slow burn? Accelerated to microwave speeds. (A detective and a criminal fell in love mid-gunfight.)

* Coffee Shop AU? Every café on Earth became a rom-com set. (Baristas now required to spill drinks on customers.)

The fandom cheered.

Then screamed.

## Chapter 3: "The AO3 Apocalypse"

The Jester wasn’t done.

* He replaced all "Major Character Death" tags with "Temporary Inconvenience." (Ghosts started haunting their own fanfics.)

* He turned "Angst" into literal weather. (It rained tears and dramatic monologues.)

* He made "Fluff" biodegradable. (People hugged and disintegrated into confetti.)

Writers stared at their screens in horror.

> "WHY CAN’T I DELETE MY FICS?!"

The Jester, lounging on a floating chaise made of burned manuscripts, sipped a margarita. "Because I said so."

## Chapter 4: "The Final Crack Ship"

The fandom’s last hope? The Anti-Jester Coalition.

A ragtag group of:

* A frustrated beta reader.

* A canon purist.

* That one fanartist who only draws hands.

They confronted him.

"You’ve gone too far!"

The Jester gasped. "Too far? I haven’t even started."

He pulled out THE FINAL LAUGH and fired.

The blast hit the entire concept of shipping.

Now:

* Every character was shipped with themselves.

* Platonic relationships required a marriage license.

* The fourth wall was just a suggestion.

The fandom collapsed into a singularity of screaming.

## Chapter 5: "The Aftermath"

When the dust settled:

* AO3 was just a single fic titled "Oops."

* Tumblr had become a sentient angst monster.

* Fanartists could only draw the Jester’s face.

And The Jester?

He left a single white flower on the ruins of the internet.

Attached was a note:

> "Ship responsibly. Or don’t. I’m not your dad."

# The Jester Gets a Therapist

## Chapter 1: The Intervention Nobody Asked For

The universe had finally had enough.

After turning gravity into a suggestion, replacing all world leaders with improv comedians, and making the concept of Mondays illegal, The Jester’s antics had reached critical mass.

A coalition of gods, scientists, and very tired civilians held an emergency summit.

"We need to do something," said a frazzled astrophysicist, clutching a stress ball that kept turning into live frogs.

"We’ve tried everything," groaned a demon, who was still picking confetti out of his fur after the Great Hell Prank of ‘23.

Then, from the back of the room, a voice piped up:

"What if… we get him therapy?"

Silence.

Then - unanimous, desperate agreement.

## Chapter 2: Dr. Evelyn Whitaker’s Worst Decision

Dr. Evelyn Whitaker was the best therapist in the multiverse.

She had calmed eldritch horrors, mediated angel-demon couples counseling, and even talked a black hole out of its existential crisis.

She was not prepared for Patient #∞.

The Jester lounged on her couch, tossing a glowing singularity like a baseball.

"So," he said, grinning. "How’s your childhood trauma?"

Dr. Whitaker adjusted her glasses. "Let’s… start with you."

## Chapter 3: Therapy Session #1

Dr. Whitaker: "What brings you here today?"

The Jester: "Boredom. Also, they - " (gestures at the universe) " - think I’m ‘unhinged.’ Rude."

Dr. Whitaker: "Do you feel your actions have consequences?"

The Jester: "Consequences are just unexpected plot twists."

She tried to take notes.

Her pen turned into a live eel.

## Chapter 4: Breakthrough (Or Breakdown?)

By session #3:

* The Rorschach test became a meme generator.

* The "happy place" visualization exercise summoned actual clowns.

* Freud’s ghost manifested just to quit.

But then - a miracle.

The Jester paused. "Okay, fine. Sometimes… I prank because if I stop, reality might… yawn… go back to being boring."

Dr. Whitaker leaned forward. "And that scares you?"

The Jester’s grin faltered - for 0.0001 seconds.

Then he snapped his fingers.

The DSM-5 became a pop-up book.

"Oops."

## Chapter 5: The Aftermath (Psychology is Dead)

Dr. Whitaker’s final report:

DIAGNOSIS: "Yes."

TREATMENT PLAN: "N/A (Burn the file.)"

PROGNOSIS: "We’re all doomed."

The Jester left a single white flower on her desk.

Attached: "Thanks for the material."

That night:

* All therapists unionized - against him.

* The concept of "mental stability" filed for bankruptcy.

* Dr. Whitaker opened a bar. It’s always packed.

*Somewhere, a psychiatry textbook spontaneously combusted. The Jester laughed.*

## Act I: The Ides of LOL

The Roman Senate was in session. Senators bickered. Caesar brooded. The air smelled of wine, ambition, and poor life choices.

Then - a firework exploded in the sacred halls.

Confetti rained down as a figure in a patched toga backflipped onto the podium, kicking over a bust of Cato.

"Salve, suckers!" The Jester grinned, adjusting a laurel wreath crookedly on his head. "Let’s liven this place up!"

Cicero dropped his scroll. "By Jupiter’s beard - WHO ARE YOU?!"

The Jester gasped. "Who am I? Who are YOU? Actually, scratch that - let’s vote on it!"

He snapped his fingers.

## Act II: The Senate Descends into Madness

* All speeches were auto-tuned into sea shanties.

* The Roman eagles mutated into parrots that only squawked "YOLO."

* Brutus’ dagger turned into a baguette mid-assassination attempt.

* Caesar’s famous last words? "Et tu, Jester?" before getting pied in the face.

Pompey stood, trembling. "**This is an outrage! Rome is-**"

"BORING!" The Jester declared, replacing the Senate floor with a bouncy castle. "Let’s fix that."

He pulled out THE FINAL LAUGH and fired.

## Act III: The Second Roman Empire

The aftermath:

* The Colosseum now hosts stand-up comedy instead of gladiator fights.

* Latin is replaced with meme hieroglyphics.

* Roads? Still lead to Rome, but Rome is now a taco truck.

* Augustus’ reign is retconned into a failed improv show.

* The Jester, now self-appointed Emperor for Life, lounged on a throne of stolen dignity.

"Best. Empire. Ever."

*Somewhere, a single white flower grew in the ruins of the Forum. It was flipping off the sunset.*

# Seeds in the Ruins

Field Notes of Dr. Evelyn Whitaker, PhD, LMFT, Unwilling Folklorist of Catastrophe

 -  collected after the Union of Therapists declared him “unreachable” and I disagreed.

---

[00:00] Eldermere, once a siege, now a story you can trip over.

The walls are still arguing with gravity. Stone rises when no one looks. A tap-dancing gargoyle clears its throat when I pass and goes still, embarrassed.

The flower is here.

It grows from a mortar seam where pudding once was. White, matte, almost paper. Four petals and a stubborn tilt, as if listening. The locals leave offerings: joke books, clown noses, a chicken-sized crown. Someone has erected a sign: PLEASE DO NOT LAUGH DIRECTLY AT THE PLANT.

I kneel. My breath fogs in the cold air, and the petals do not stir. I do not touch. I hum, instead, a childhood rhyme my father used to butcher on Sunday mornings. In the echo, a foot soldier (alive, retired, buys bread from a bakery that used to be a ballista) tells me the same story for the third time:

“I almost laughed,” he says, palms open. “Not at him. At… us. At how afraid we were, and suddenly it was all ridiculous. But then the moment slipped. Like stepping to the edge of a dock and not jumping.”

As he speaks, the flower brightens - not opens, not blooms, but brightens - just enough to mark a reading on my instruments: a rise in anticipatory response. A punchline held in the throat.

I add to the sign: PLEASE DO NOT FORCE IT EITHER.

---

[03:17] St. Bartholomew’s, or what’s left of it.

Glitter is still in the mortar. The graffiti refuses to be repainted; every layer of beige peels back to reveal Yo-Mama scripture in Comic Sans. The reverend’s voice remains squeaky. He is kind about it.

There are three flowers here. One on the altar where he shouted ENOUGH. One in the choir loft near the hymnal that turned into a fish. One on a pew where an old woman clutched pearls until they became dice.

The altar flower dims when the reverend recounts his rage. It brightens when he repeats a joke a child told him, terribly. The pew flower pulses when two teenagers sit and whisper a secret that ends in the smallest, unwilling smile.

Under the largest pane of surviving glass - Saint Bartholomew now mid-rickroll - I find a fourth thing: a coordinate tucked into the graffiti layers. A string of symbols that resolve if you stop trying to read them and let them be overheard. It is not a place so much as a direction. The paint points toward an Archivist.

He was here, of course. He is always already gone. His calling card rests beneath the lectern: a single white flower, unharmed by ash.

---

[06:55] Rome, the taco truck version.

The Forum laughs for tourists on the hour. The bouncy senate floor is deflated now, sun-bleached. Latin returns in palindromes on every placard. ET TU, UTE TE.

The flower here is a bud.

That is wrong. Or new. Or important.

I sit beside it as the sunset licks columns that are no longer columns. I do not bring instruments out. I do not hum. I breathe. It does not open, but I feel the pressure of a punchline around it like weather.

“You found that one,” says a voice behind me, and every flock of pigeons in Rome pretends to be statues again.

He does not announce himself so much as the air leaves to make space. Coat shifting colors. Hair as if the wind is a rumor. THE FINAL LAUGH slung casual as a violin.

“Hello,” I say. “I have questions.”

“You always do.” His grin cuts. “You’re doing field work. I approve. Academia needed more confetti.”

I gesture at the bud. “Why won’t it bloom?”

He tips his head. For 0.0001 seconds, I see a face without a joke. A boy, maybe, at the end of a dock. Then the mask returns, deliberate.

“Timing,” he says. “Comedy is timing.”

“You didn’t finish something here.”

He looks past me, to a square that is also a punchline. “I refuse to finish many things. It’s a hobby.”

“You force everything else.”

He laughs, gentle for once, and the pigeons forget their roles. “Do I?” He considers. “No. I perform. They expect. The gun only fires where an audience hangs its breath.” He taps THE FINAL LAUGH. The launcher does not gleam; it broods. “Silence is harder.”

“Then this is silence.”

“Perhaps.” He squats, elbows on knees, chin on hands, the bud between us. “Perhaps this is where I learned to shut up.”

I do not look at him. It feels like a trick. “Who?”

“A kid,” he says. “Wouldn’t laugh.”

“Wouldn’t?”

“Couldn’t. Shouldn’t. Choose your flavor of fate.” He rocks back to standing, the sky taking him for a moment like a stage light. “I did not press. The world did not end. I hated it.”

“And then you left flowers.”

“And then I left invitations.” His grin resets. “It photographs better.”

The bud does not move. He does. He is gone in the way that makes the present tense into a liar.

I exhale. The pigeons applaud politely.

---

[09:42] AO3 crater, Fandom Weather Station.

Angst drizzle at 70%. Fluff biodegradable warnings posted. The servers hum a lullaby. The sentient moderation bot asks me to sign a waiver.

Flowers grow in the gaps between tags that never fit. One on the line between canon and crack. One where a writer tried to delete a fic and couldn’t. One, strangely, on the edge of a coffee shop that is every coffee shop.

I read comments aloud. The plants answer not to laughter but to consent: “I wanted this,” makes them glow. “I didn’t,” makes them fold slightly, not harmed but unamused.

I chart resonance on a map that does not want to be mapped. When I link Rome to the church to Eldermere to here, a shape emerges - a spiral, petal-lapped - and in its center, a missing point.

The direction from the graffiti resolves with the newly drawn curve. The Archivist waits where jokes go when they are almost told.

---

[12:01] Notes on Method.

I do not pluck. Locals try. When they do, reality rubber-bands to the most expected ending of the moment. A knight who wanted a story to be noble dies nobly after all, his bakery becomes a ballad, his children learn to weep properly. The city loses its weird kindness for an afternoon. The flower is gone, the air is thinner.

When we wait, something else happens. People write jokes together. A child mistakes a gargoyle for a friend and the gargoyle tries honesty for an hour. A reverend admits he laughed in the sacristy and the saints do not resign. The city keeps its strangeness.

Conclusion (provisional): the flowers are deferred punchlines. Energy held in expectation. Do not cash them. Invite them.

---

[14:33] Back in my office, which is a booth in a bar I helped open by accident.

I pin photos to cork. I draw lines that blur to vines when I blink. I leave the bud from Rome circled and uncrossed.

The Union texts. “Update?”

I write: “He is not unreachable. He is intentionally unreachED. There’s a difference.”

Before I hit send, a white petal falls onto the screen. It didn’t fall from anywhere. It is not mine.

On the back, in handwriting that looks like a drum roll: YOU’RE INVITED.

Below it, smaller: Don’t force it.

---

[17:00] Addendum: The Launcher.

I asked no one and everyone about THE FINAL LAUGH. Veterans, vicars, Romans, fanfic moderators. The answers rhyme.

- It works best when you expect it.
- It misfires in silence.
- It changes shape when the crowd thinks it will be kind.

Working rule: it is not a weapon; it is a metronome for an audience’s breath. He aims at timing, not people.

Which makes The Mime - who breathes without sound - the most dangerous thing he’s ever met.

I hope the Archivist likes visitors.

---

[19:59] Personal.

I am not impartial. He thanked me for the material once. He was right. I am writing this like a case report to pretend I am outside it. I am not. I want one laugh to land without anyone dying of it. I want a flower to open because it wants to.

I want to see what he refused to finish.

If this is an origin, I will not explain it. I will show up. I will listen.

And I will not force it.

# Petal Logic

Extracts from the Archive of Unfinished Laughter: A Contract, Being a Conversation in Legal Form

Parties: Dr. Evelyn Whitaker (hereafter “Witness”), and The Archivist of Unused Endings (hereafter “Archivist”). The Jester appears as a marginal presence only. [1]

Venue: A reading room that is also a waiting room, which is also a page. The lamps hum in iambic. Dust motes are ellipses.

Date: Whenever a punchline is about to arrive and chooses not to.

---

## Article I — Definitions

1.1 “Deferred Punchline” means the energy stored when a laugh is nearly honest but uncoerced and therefore withheld. [2]

1.2 “Flower” means a physical manifestation of a Deferred Punchline, typically white, petalled, and rude. [3]

1.3 “Redemption” means the act of plucking a Flower to settle its stored energy into the most expected resolution available to the observing crowd at the moment of pluckage. [4]

1.4 “Agency” means the capacity of persons to choose timing, tone, and participation in laughter without external compulsion (including but not limited to divine props, algorithmic pressure, and weaponized punchlines). [5]

1.5 “Silence” means the acoustic and conceptual condition under which timing cannot be stolen. [6]

---

## Article II — Recitals

WHEREAS the Witness has observed multiple Flowers at prior disturbance sites (see Case Notes: 'Seeds in the Ruins'),

WHEREAS Redemption was tested locally and found to foreclose alternative futures,

WHEREAS the Archivist maintains custody of Unused Endings in perpetuity (or until told properly),

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties stipulate as follows.

---

## Article III — The Offer

3.1 The Archivist offers the Witness one (1) Redemption without surcharge to resolve an active civic crisis of the Witness’s choosing. [7]

3.2 The Archivist shall additionally disclose a Cartographic Apparatus (“the Map”) capable of locating concentrations of Deferred Punchlines across contiguous realities, calibrated to the Witness’s consent vector. [8]

3.3 Consideration: The Witness will deliver to the Archive an Account of Silence, comprising (a) an instance in which the Witness chose not to finish a patient; (b) the community outcome; and (c) the laughter (or lack thereof) recorded thereafter. [9]

---

## Article IV — Representations and Warranties

4.1 The Archivist represents that Redemption saves lives quickly. [10]

4.2 The Archivist does not warrant that lives thus saved will be anyone’s to live. [11]

4.3 The Witness represents that she will not laugh merely to make a measurement spike. [12]

4.4 The Witness does not warrant that others will not try. [13]

---

## Article V — Demonstration (Excerpted)

The Archivist places on the table a vellum city, folded to the scale of breath. In its streets: panic, smoke, and a siren that is also a rumor. At its center: a white point, budded.

ARCHIVIST: “Pluck it. Save them.”

WITNESS: “At what price?”

ARCHIVIST: “The median joke. The most expected ending. A good death instead of a strange survival. Clean grief. Gratitude. They will say you did the right thing.”

WITNESS: “And if I wait?”

ARCHIVIST: “Possibility proliferates. So does harm. Someone invents a different way to be together. Someone else is late and lives because of it. A third person never speaks again. The page stays open. I do not keep ledgers for open books.”

WITNESS: “You could.”

ARCHIVIST (smiles like a footnote): “I would become an Editor.” [14]

The Witness does not touch the vellum. The siren modulates to a choir warm-up. In one window, a joke misfires and becomes kindness. In another, a thief returns bread without being seen.

ARCHIVIST: “This is your one clean shot.”

WITNESS: “I refuse.”

The bud brightens, does not bloom. The room’s dust settles in ellipses again.

---

## Article VI — The Map

6.1 Upon refusal of Redemption, the Archivist produces the Map: a ring-bound atlas that is actually a spiral, that is actually a breathing. Pages reorder to align with whichever consent the Witness can hear. [15]

6.2 The Map shows: Eldermere’s seam; St. Bartholomew’s altar; the Forum bud; the AO3 weather station; and a missing center labeled, in marginal script, “Origin.” [16]

6.3 The Map will not display any location where the Witness intends to coerce a laugh. It grays itself rather than be complicit. [17]

6.4 Cost: The Witness will deposit, upon first bloom she witnesses without intervention, a sworn description of the timing that made it possible. [18]

---

## Article VII — Covenants

7.1 The Archivist shall not disclose to the Editor the locations of Flowers currently used as community wayfinding or memorial sites. [19]

7.2 The Witness shall not publish instructions for forced blooming.

7.3 Neither party shall define “honest laugh” in a way that can be litigated. [20]

7.4 In the presence of the Mime, both parties will sign in gesture.

---

## Article VIII — Remedies

8.1 In the event of unilateral Redemption by a third party, the Witness may petition the Archive to record the lost possibilities. The Archive will bind them as “Could-Have-Beens,” available for study but not reentry. [21]

8.2 In the event the Editor attempts to outlaw Flowers categorically, the Archivist will hide the Map inside a story that refuses to end. [22]

8.3 Specific performance is not available. Laughter cannot be compelled without becoming something else.

---

## Article IX — Execution

The Archivist slides a pen that is also a quill that is also a ticking. The Witness does not sign. She initialises the margins.

ARCHIVIST: “A non-binding agreement, then.”

WITNESS: “A binding disagreement.”

ARCHIVIST: “Acceptable.”

A petal falls onto the signature line and refuses to be ink.

---

## Signatures 

Archivist: [                    ]

Witness:   [ E. W. ] (marginal)

---

## Footnotes

[1] The Jester wrote “hi” in the gutter and was erased by an eraser that apologized. He will try again. He always does.

[2] Deferred does not mean denied. See also: breath held, rooms that hush before truth.

[3] Botanically incorrect; metaphysically precise. The rudeness is an emergent property of restraint.

[4] “Most expected” is measured against the audience currently paying attention. Change the audience, change the end. See also §6.3.

[5] Agency includes the right not to be an audience. Earplugs are lawful. So is leaving.

[6] Silence is not the absence of sound but the presence of respect. The Mime litigates this point in motion.

[7] “Without surcharge” excludes metaphysical taxes. The Archive is exempt from irony tariffs but not from grief duties.

[8] Consent vector: a direction you can only point by listening. Instruments fail; witnesses don’t.

[9] The Archive elevates stories of not-finishing. It starves Editors.

[10] This clause was drafted by a pragmatic pessimist in a burning year.

[11] Lives lived after Redemption exhibit statistical conformity to genre tropes for a period of 3–7 narrative beats. Side effects include neatness, gratitude, and a loss you can finally hold.

[12] “Measurement spike” refers to the phenomenon recorded in 'Seeds in the Ruins': flowers pulsing in response to proximal almost-laughter.

[13] They will. Make signs. Teach better jokes.

[14] The Archivist and Editor share a parentage and a grudge. Ask neither about footnotes.

[15] If the Map curls into a question mark, stop asking and start listening.

[16] The Forum bud is special. Do not pick it; it will embarrass you by not being yours to pick.

[17] The Map is moral but not pious. It withholds; it does not punish.

[18] Timing is communal. If you credit only yourself, the entry redacts your name.

[19] The Editor has tried before, styling Flowers as continuity errors. The Archive misfiles the memo in Humor: Dark, and loses it on purpose.

[20] Attempts include: “A laugh that doesn’t hurt anyone,” which is charming and false; “A laugh everyone agrees on,” which is tyranny; “A laugh that belongs,” which is closer.

[21] Scholars may annotate Could-Have-Beens. No one may finish them.

[22] Recommended hiding places: an improv game that never pulls a card; a story that credits its author as “Audience.”

---

## Postscript — Map Delivery

The Map arrives as a ring-binder that sighs when opened. First page: a spiral route toward a place labeled, simply, BEFORE. The Witness presses her palm to it and hears a dock, and water, and a child not laughing, and the sound the world makes when someone doesn’t force it.

The lamps click off, in timing.

# The Last Kid Who Won’t Laugh

Field Notes of Dr. Evelyn Whitaker

- composed without a recorder, as requested.

---

[00:00] Present - The town that speaks softly

Off-season. Boardwalk shutters breathing in and out with the tide. Arcade lights blink on schedule to no one. Gulls open their beaks and make no sound. Even the wind behaves politely.

The Map curls into a question mark until I pocket every instrument. My hands empty. A white ribbon (paper-thin, black-edged) is tied to my wrist by the air itself, or by a memory I am walking into.

There is a dock. It does not creak unless permitted.

A chalk arrow on the planks points forward.

---

[THEN-1] Flashback - The dock, years ago

The Jester arrives like a rumor learning to be a man. Coat that can’t pick a color. Hair that disrespects gravity as a lifestyle choice. THE FINAL LAUGH resting on his shoulder like a punchline waiting to be adopted.

A small crowd. Vacationers. A fisherman with hands that remember. A kid at the very end of the dock, shoes off, feet above a green-brown mirror.

He tunes the air the way performers do: a held breath, a pulled string.

Nothing answers.

The launcher hums. Then gutters.

He smiles bigger. That always works. It does not.

---

[00:11] Present - First contact

They’re waiting at the rail: a figure in layered gray, face open but unreadable, chalk on one palm, eraser in the other. A bouquet of paper-white buds tucked in the crook of their elbow.

A gesture: palm to heart, palm to air, two fingers to the dock. Welcome. Agree to the floor.

I nod. I sit. My notebook stays closed. The chalk writes a circle that isn’t a circle around us both.

Rules arrive as movements:

- Ask before you perform.

- Time laughs to breath, not to weapons.

- Leave endings open when they belong to others.

I sign back, clumsy. They smile without teeth, which in this town is a compliment.

---

[THEN-2] Flashback - Escalation fails

The Jester begins with small chaos: a coin that turns into a fish that turns into a kite that turns into rain which is glitter which is rain again. People gasp and grin and ready themselves for the part where they are made into the bit.

The kid watches. Not resistant, not enthralled. Present.

The Jester turns to sight gags that get cheaper as they get bigger. A tower of chairs balanced on a bird. The sky swapping places with the water. A piano landing wrong-way-up and playing a song about bananas in a time signature incapable of remorse.

The crowd laughs as trained. The kid covers their ears and shakes their head once. Not “no” to laughter. “No” to being taken.

The launcher dims like a spotlight starved of ushers.

---

[00:23] Present - The Mime teaches

They place the buds between the boards, one per shadow. They gesture: you first. Share a memory you can turn slightly funny without stealing it from yourself.

I choose the day a black hole told me it was tired. The punchline is less cruel than you expect and more human: it missed being small.

Two shoulders near us shake. No one watches them to force the laugh to come.

The buds quiver. Not blooming. Listening.

---

[THEN-3] Flashback - The hesitation

He tries voice. A whispered aside only one person hears. The kid’s mouth does not move. He tries timing tricks: threaten a pause, deliver a pause, violate the pause. The pause learns his cadence and refuses to belong to him.

There is a strip of wood between two boards where a splinter has been teaching the harbor to be patient.

He sets THE FINAL LAUGH down.

The crowd bleats confusion. Someone asks if this is part of it. He neither confirms nor denies. He sits on the dock beside the kid like a man seeing a bench for the first time.

They watch the water. The launcher is heavy enough to stop being a metaphor.

A white point gathers between the boards.

---

[00:41] Present - Translations

We converse with hands and chalk, with the consent ribbon ticking against my pulse.

I ask: Who taught you?

They answer by drawing a dock. A pair of feet. A rectangle like a gun but softened at the corners. Then an arrow away from it.

I write: Why flowers?

They draw an ellipsis. Petals on each dot. Then erase the middle dot. The chalk dust hovers and does not settle. We wait. The dust resolves into a fourth dot that is only there because we did not exhale too fast.

I write: Will you show me the first?

They draw the word BEFORE and box it in silence.

---

[THEN-4] Flashback - The choice

The Jester’s body learns something his face won’t say: he can force this, but then the shape of the laugh will be wrong forever.

He breathes out without turning it into smoke. He resists a pun that would have killed. He lets the kid not be an audience.

The kid uncovers their ears. Their shoulders drop. They do not laugh. They make room in the air where someone else could.

Between the planks: the first white bud.

He leaves the launcher. He stands without it. He fails to bow. He walks away without a signature.

Later, because masks are easier than faces, he starts leaving flowers where he almost learned this lesson again.

---

[01:05] Present - The circle of invitation

The Mime marks a wider circle. Townspeople drift in; no one is summoned. A grandmother offers the memory of a joke told to her by a man who is gone. She tells it badly on purpose. Someone exhales a “ha” so small the gulls lean to hear.

A boy raises a hand and asks, with his mouth closed, if he can try. He shows a rubber band and a coin and does nothing with either. The “ha” becomes three “ha”s in different throats. The buds brighten like bioluminescence that respects boundaries.

I hold back a clinician’s impulse to take notes. I let myself be audience to timing I do not own.

---

[THEN-5] Flashback - Aftermath

That night, a fisherman went home earlier than grief had scheduled and found his daughter awake and angry and ready to forgive him for something small. That did not fix anything. That changed the next joke that could be told without anyone dying of it.

On the dock, a petal thought about opening and decided to stay closed until someone asked nicely.

He came back three times. He brought tricks and put them down at the edge of the circle and stepped backward until he was standing with everyone else.

When he finally laughed that week, it was at himself. Quietly. Nothing exploded.

---

[01:33] Present - Reveal

The Mime opens their palm. A tiny scar runs along the heel, pale and shaped like a smile someone folded closed.

I know then without being told. The child is here, taller, patient. Guardian of silence, not enemy of joy.

They trace letters on the dock with one finger: M I M E. Then shake their head. They erase it and draw a listening ear instead.

I sign: Thank you.

They sign: Invite better.

They tuck one paper bud behind my ear. It stays a bud. Good.

---

[01:59] Present - The white ribbon

Before I leave, they retie the ribbon on my wrist tighter. I feel the dock consider making a sound and decide not to.

The Map in my bag turns a page on its own. BEFORE hums in the spine.

Behind me, laughter - small, local, consented to - catches like a match in a windless room and stays a glow instead of a fire.

---

Appendix - Notes I wrote later and then crossed out

- THE FINAL LAUGH is a metronome for audiences; in silence, it can’t steal the count-in.
- Flowers mark the space between impulse and action; blooms are decisions, buds are invitations.
- The Mime isn’t anti-laughter. They are pro-timing.
- The first white flower didn’t “appear.” It was allowed.

I leave these uncrossed for now. The ribbon reminds me not to close what isn’t mine.

# The Silence Act

Field Notes of Dr. Evelyn Whitaker

- conducted without microphones or meters.

---

[00:00] The cut

A city trending for grief.

Screens open like mouths.

The Mime draws a circle in chalk around downtown and closes their hand.

Sound folds.

Sirens flicker silently. News vans mouth words that evaporate. A helicopter hangs like an idea and decides to land.

People check their throats and find them intact. Breath in. Breath out. No broadcast.

On lamp posts, paper signs bloom:

- Quiet Hours: Now.

- Consent for Sound: Ask.

- Emergencies: Hands Up, Fingers Two.

---

[00:07] Triage, without alarms

Paramedics raise two fingers. The Mime nods.

A small circle opens like a pupil. Within it, sound returns in grayscale - gauze tearing, zipper teeth, pulse beeps at library volume.

Outside the circle: shoes on asphalt that do not scuff; crying that is felt in shoulders only.

When the ambulance doors close, the circle closes too. The beeps fade to memory, not content.

---

[00:13] Arrival of the performer

Coat in colors that don’t agree. Hair still rumor-proof. THE FINAL LAUGH across his back like a cello case he forgot is dangerous.

He mouths a “ta-da.” The air does not carry it.

He throws a card; it becomes a dove; it becomes a cloud; it becomes a card again. No applause collects. The trick droops under its own expectation.

He tries bigger: a building’s shadow juggling cars (careful), confetti that refuses to land, a pie that never quite hits a face.

He listens. He sets the launcher down. He sits on the curb beside everyone else.

---

[00:21] Negotiation, by gesture

I find the Mime at the chalk seam.

Palm to heart. Palm to air. Two fingers.

I sign: Care needs windows. News needs none.

They sign: Two minutes per request. Only within circles. No cameras. No names.

I sign: Funerals?

They sign: Bells only when invited by next of kin.

We mark circles. We post times. We nod. The chalk brightens like it understands policy.

---

[00:34] Rings

The first ring opens around an ICU. Sound returns in a soft radius. Monitors relearn their voices. Nurses move like conductors. A baby decides this is a good moment and proves it.

The second ring opens in a kitchen. Oil whispers. A mother hums one note. Her child taps a spoon against a glass and stops when the mother touches their wrist and asks with eyes. The child nods. One tap, permitted.

The third ring opens in a courtyard. Shoes scuff. A broom argues with concrete and loses politely.

---

[00:49] The Jester tries nothing

He draws a square on the pavement and steps into it. He does not perform. He learns the breath of the block. Inhale as one, exhale as many.

He raises THE FINAL LAUGH like a baton. No primer hum. No threat. He looks to the circle guardians stationed at each corner; waits.

A guardian lifts a hand. The baton dips once.

In the square, one bit happens: a dropped orange rolls in a circle and refuses to leave the chalk. Its peel unspools and spells a question mark. No one laughs. Someone almost does. The baton does not insist.

---

[00:56] A permitted laugh

At the memorial wall, chalk names blur under fingers. A woman touches a name and then her chest.

She looks up. Two fingers.

The Mime opens a coin-sized window.

The woman says one syllable. It is not a name and not a joke. It is the sound people make when they find a photograph behind another photograph.

It lands. It ripples.

Near her, a boy watches an ant fail to move a crumb. He nudges the crumb closer, very slightly. The ant succeeds. The boy lets out a “ha,” small as a pin.

No one looks at him to harvest it. The “ha” stays his.

The circles widen like tree rings.

---

[01:07] Content attempts content

A drone wanders in like a gull that took a night class. The Mime points. The drone drops as if remembering gravity is a consent-based service.

A streamer mouths outrage at low volume, chewing consonants for show. Their chat scrolls invisibly. They leave, bored of not being amplified.

The paper signs accrue doodles: little flowers, little ears.

---

[01:19] A quiet show

He sweeps the square with his palm. The baton follows his hand like a pendulum.

He mimes a story no one asked for and then stops before the ending. He draws a loose bow-tie on the pavement. A dog wanders in and sits in it because it fits. People smile with their eyes; no one says “good boy” aloud. The dog’s tail answers for them.

He looks at me. I shake my head: not yet. He nods as if he asked. Consent is quicker than language today.

---

[01:31] Bells

At the edge of the circle, a family lifts a small bell. The Mime nods. It rings once. The city hears it because the city chose to.

The bell’s tail note lands on the baton like a sparrow. He keeps his hand steady until it flies on.

[01:40] The single laugh that returns the birds

A toddler in a stroller sees a pigeon wearing a ring pop. (Do not ask who gave it. Do not make this about virality. Let the image be.)

The toddler claps silently, then looks at their parent. The parent raises two fingers to the Mime. The circle allows a breath of sound.

The toddler laughs - round, new, unsharable. The pigeon coos on-key.

The guttering city relights one block at a time.

---

[01:52] Aftercare

We post Quiet Hours as a habit. We stencil ears on benches where listening is the point. We add a line to the signs:

- Laughter: Welcome when invited.

He ties a white ribbon with a black edge around THE FINAL LAUGH’s barrel. It looks less like a cannon, more like a conductor’s baton that remembers.

He writes with chalk beside the ribbon: ASK FIRST.

The Mime nods.

---

[02:10] Debrief, written later

- Silence is not absence. It is space made.

- THE FINAL LAUGH behaves under invitation like timing, not force.

- News is a sound thief when unsupervised. The city can supervise itself.

- We earned one laugh today. It was enough to turn birds back on.

The circles faded at sunset. The chalk did not wash away. It is listening for the next hand.

# Museum of Unused Endings

Docent Notes, Field Additions by Dr. Evelyn Whitaker

- evening entry granted for “Listening Hour.” No exhibits to be finished. No outcomes to be purchased. No filming. No Editor.

---

[00:00] Admission

A door that looks like a footnote opens at the end of a sentence that refuses a period. We enter on tickets made of unspent breath.

The Archivist waits in a jacket the color of margins. The Jester trails a step behind, ribbon tied around THE FINAL LAUGH, eyes hungry for an encore he promises not to take.

DOCENT (Archivist): “Welcome to the Vault. You may read. You may witness. You may invite. You may not conclude.”

Signs:
- Please keep your timing to yourself until asked.
- If an exhibit begins to resolve, step back and let it decide.
- Flowers are not props.

I add a fourth with a pen that becomes a pencil: “No plucking.”

---

[00:09] Gallery A - The Almost Confession

Placard:

Title: The Almost Confession
Medium: Breath caught between “I” and “love”
Provenance: Kitchen, 2 a.m., tile cold, light off to keep courage from spooking
Status: Deferred

The piece is a chair and a shadow and a mug that remembers a mouth. On the table: a single white bud in a bottle.

JESTER (whisper, out of habit, swallowed by the room): “One flick and this lands.”

I shake my head. We read the wall text together:

Curatorial Note: Completion collapses possibility to one grateful path. Invitation proliferates futures. The Archive favors proliferation.

A visitor (teen, glitter eyeliner, hands steady) stands near the bud and tells the chair, softly, the version of the story she can afford tonight. It isn’t a confession. It is a promise to be braver tomorrow. The bud brightens and then dims without shame.

The Jester’s fingers flex on the ribbon. He does not raise the baton.

---

[00:21] Gallery B - The Joke That Would Have Saved Him

Placard:

Title: The Joke That Would Have Saved Him

Medium: Timing missed by a traffic light and a pride that wouldn’t bend

Provenance: Corner store, closing time, two men and a history

Status: Irretrievable if forced

The stage is taped on the floor. The light cue is a streetlamp that is also a halo that is also a warning. In the wings, a white bud leans away from a counterfeit laugh track.

The Jester paces at the boundary. He could fix this. He could not fix this. Both statements are true.

DOCENT: “Finishing creates an alibi labeled Fate. We don’t issue those.”

We host a “listening minute.” People step into the taped square one by one, raise two fingers toward the ceiling, lower them with an apology to someone not present. No punchline arrives. No one dies this time either. The bud holds.

---

[00:33] Gallery C - The Letter Never Sent

Placard:

Title: The Letter Never Sent

Medium: Paper that tastes like rain

Provenance: Desk drawer, three addresses, all correct

Status: Folded, not sealed

The envelope is translucent enough to show a handwriting that might be yours if you changed your mind about being afraid. A white bud rests in the stamp’s place.

Visitors sit at a long table with blindfolds available. They write nothing. The Archivist collects blank pages reverently and returns them to the same pile.

THE JESTER (to me, almost honest): “I want to give them a line to stand on.”

ME: “Give them a floor instead.”

He draws a rectangle on the table with his fingertip. It becomes a small stage. He does not step on it. People place their blank pages there. The bud warms. No one licks it.

---

[00:45] Interruption - The Editor’s Shadow

A red line crawls under the gallery titles like an impatient understudy.

EDITORIAL NOTICE (disembodied, precise): “Closure reduces harm; ambiguity breeds contagion. Approve corrections?”

The Archivist smiles without teeth. Opens a drawer labeled HUMOR: DARK. Folds the red line carefully. Files it wrong.

DOCENT (to the room): “The Editor prefers endings. Tonight prefers beginnings.”

THE JESTER (low): “Let me at least… tidy one.”

ME: “Host instead.”

He nods. The ribbon tightens.

---

[00:52] Gallery D - The Crowd That Never Let Her Finish

Placard:

Title: The Crowd That Never Let Her Finish

Medium: Microphone that sparks; chorus of interruptions; one joke with a spine

Provenance: Comedy night, cover charge waived for hecklers

Status: Interrupted

The stage is empty except for a mic stand that won’t stand straight until invited. In the front row: a small white bud tucked under a seat.

We set chairs in a circle on the stage instead. The sign on the door flips to LISTENING HOUR.

I host. It is a job you do with palms and breath:
- Agree on consent.
- Agree on time.
- Agree to let quiet do the heavy lifting.

People tell beginnings. The mic remains off. The Jester sits in the circle with his hands visible. When someone gestures “now,” he raises the baton an inch, then an inch more, then not at all. He relays, he does not lead.

A woman with a scar that curves like a parentheses tells the opening to her oldest joke. She reaches the spot where the room always takes it away. The room does not. She keeps it. She lands it. It isn’t even that funny. It is hers.

Under the seat, the white bud… opens.

It opens not like victory but like timing arriving home.

The Archivist bows to the audience, not to the artifact.

---

[01:14] Catalog Entry - First Bloom Without Plucking

Archive Record: BLOOM-001/COMMUNITY

Description: Exhibit D’s bud opened upon communal refusal to seize punchline; no individual “finished.”

Contributing Factors:
- Hosted timing (E. Whitaker)
- Baton held in relay mode (Jester)
- Silence stewarded (Mime, offstage, consent signage)
- Audience agreement logged verbally, not notarized

Outcomes:
- Room laughter: low amplitude, high ownership
- Editor’s red line: loses adhesion inside circle; resumes in hallway, grumbling
- Bud: petals remain; stem strengthens; scent described as “relief”

Disposition: Returned to exhibit with a new placard tag: BLOOMED (INVITED).

---

[01:27] The Heist We Didn’t Commit

We had a shopping list we never said out loud:
- Steal “The Joke That Would Have Saved Him.”
- Steal the mic from Gallery D.
- Steal a map from the gift shop that marks “Origin.”

We leave with none of them.

Instead, the Archivist tucks into my pocket a card that says “Admission: Ongoing” and winks like a librarian who shelved a dangerous book behind a children’s display.

THE JESTER (half-grin): “I’m worse at stealing now.”

ME: “You’re better at staying.”

He bows to the audience and means it.

---

[01:39] Gift Shop - Items for People Who Don’t Want Items

- Postcards of blank pages.
- Stickers that read ASK FIRST and LEAVE OPEN.
- A ribbon (white, black-edged).
- A bell with no clapper; it rings when you remember the point.

The Map on a spinning rack refuses to be purchased. It turns to a page labeled BEFORE when I pass, then to a page labeled ORIGIN when I look away.

The cashier is a placard that says PAY WHAT YOU WON’T REGRET.

---

[01:52] Exit Through the Listening Hour

A small crowd remains in Gallery D long after the docent calls time. The mic is still off. The chairs have learned a circle’s patience.

At the threshold, the Archivist stamps our tickets with an emblem: a petal drawn like an ellipsis.

DOCENT: “Remember: if you must finish, finish your own.”

Outside, the Jester ties his ribbon tighter. The Mime draws a little ear on the door. I file field notes that refuse to end with a moral.

The Editor leaves a voicemail we do not play.

---

Appendix - Operating Manual Excerpt (Community Timing)

- Precondition: People who want to be here.
- Tools: circle, time, consent signs, baton that knows how to wait.
- Host script:
  - Set the rule: we don’t take endings; we hold them.
  - Invite: who wants to try the first beat?
  - When a laugh threatens to become a harvest, look down. The urge passes.
  - If a bud blooms, acknowledge it and move on.
- Metrics: none that monetise. One that matters-someone’s breath easing.

If pressed for a conclusion, deny it kindly. Point to the placard. The museum is open late.

# The Bloom

Case File: Rome - Forum Bud Proceeding

Compiled by Dr. Evelyn Whitaker

Format: Redlined manuscript. Edits proposed by THE EDITOR; margins annotated by ARCHIVIST; crowd votes logged by hand-raise; outcomes recorded by scent and air pressure. THE JESTER present as facilitator; THE MIME present as silence steward.

---

[00:00] Continuity Decree - Filing

EDITORIAL ORDER 0.1 (Broadcast):

> Whereas the proliferation of white flowers constitutes a continuity hazard;

> Whereas deferred punchlines produce narrative drift, social confusion, and legal ambiguity;

> Therefore, by the authority vested in the Canon, Flowers are hereby classified as Errors, to be corrected by immediate closure. Pluck on sight. Approve corrections.

Buttons appear over the city like weather:

[ ACCEPT ]   [ REJECT ]

Citizens freeze. The buttons hover above heads, above fountains, above the Forum where the bud waits. The air tastes like a pen biting paper.

ARCHIVIST (margin): If you must click anything today, click your tongue.

---

[00:06] Scene - Forum, Assembled

We gather at the taco truck Rome became, then past it to the stones that remember empire and improv. The bud - still closed - rests between two ancient cracks.

THE JESTER ties a white ribbon with a black edge tight around THE FINAL LAUGH. He does not shoulder it. He carries it like a conductor would carry time.

THE MIME draws a wide circle and signs: Ask before endings.

Overhead, a page of the sky goes white.

EDITOR (tracked change):

- Insert: AUGUSTUS speech, revised for gravitas.
- Insert: thunder.
- Insert: one hero act (singular) to satisfy closure metrics.

[ ACCEPT ]   [ REJECT ]

CROWD (hands): mixed, uncertain.

ME (host voice): We can decide the method before the story. Process first. Then content.

We agree:
- No plucking.
- No single hero ending.
- Consent circles for sound.
- Laughter permitted only when invited by someone who holds the moment.

Buttons dim slightly, as if embarrassed.

---

[00:15] Exhibit - Redlines in the Street

The Editor’s marks crawl across facades:

- Replace Latin palindrome signage with Canon Latin. [ ACCEPT ] [ REJECT ]
- Replace bouncy Senate floor with marble (load-bearing). [ ACCEPT ] [ REJECT ]
- Replace stand-up Colosseum with gladiatorial accuracy. [ ACCEPT ] [ REJECT ]

Tourists reach. Locals wait. The Archivist passes out pencils labeled WAIT.

Children begin to play a game: they shout “Reject!” in whispers and point at nothing; when adults laugh, the kids glare. Laughter returns to throats and stays there, domesticated.

Decisions tally in chalk:
- Palindromes: REJECT (by chorus; the sign reads ET TU, UTE TE and smiles).
- Bouncy floor: REJECT (unanimous; knees thanked the assembly).
- Colosseum: REJECT (majority; a small plaque reads: we prefer jokes to murder).

The redlines lift where refused. Where accepted (one piazza asked for less confetti): the world obliges kindly.

---

[00:27] Focus - The Bud

EDITOR (tracked change, targeted):

- Insert: Hand of Fate enters frame.
- Action: Pluck flower.
- Payoff: Closure achieved. The city sighs in relief.

[ ACCEPT ]   [ REJECT ]

THE JESTER lowers the baton into the circle. Eyes on the crowd, not the plant.

ME: The floor is yours - together. Who holds this moment?

A seamstress raises two fingers. A child raises one. A historian coughs politely. We form a small chorus. The Mime opens a sound window the size of a palm.

SEAMSTRESS: “I was asked to fix a flag. I mended a joke instead.”

CHILD: (holds up a coin; does nothing with it; looks at us and waits)

HISTORIAN: “We tried empire once. It didn’t bloom.”

Audible smiles. No harvest.

The bud tilts as if listening, more.

---

[00:35] Editor’s Push - Hero Algorithm

EDITOR (macro change):

- Consolidate protagonists → 1 (JESTER).
- Set trait → Redeemer.
- Cue single decisive act → Fire THE FINAL LAUGH.

[ ACCEPT ]   [ REJECT ]

THE JESTER looks at the button. Then at the baton. Then at the bud. He flips the launcher around and offers the grip to the crowd.

THE JESTER (no mic): “You conduct.”

Hands reach and then hesitate. One person does not take it; five people do, together. The baton turns less like a weapon and more like a handle on a shared breath.

We lift.

Nothing explodes.

---

[00:42] The Moment - Co-authored Punchline

We hold the baton steady toward the bud and do the smallest bit we can that isn’t a trick:

- A grandmother tells half a knock-knock and stops.
- A mason taps a rhythm into the stone; a pigeon lands on the off-beat and coos.
- The Mime mimes a door and forgets to open it; someone else opens it for them; everyone nods.

The air pulls in. Not spectacle. Attention.

The bud opens.

It opens because no one asked it to. It opens because we left space around it shaped like a laugh that could belong to anyone.

Scent: relief, warm bread, lemon peel. Air pressure: rainswept without rain.

Buttons above our heads flash once and then dim to icons no one wants.

EDITORIAL ORDER 0.1 (status): partially unenforceable where consent is documented.

ARCHIVIST (margin): See? The canon isn’t a prison. It’s a guest book.

---

[00:51] Fallout - Redlines Lose Adhesion

Across the city, brackets fall from sentences. Marble remembers being a stage. The Colosseum schedules a double-bill: comedy first, then a nap.

The Editor files a supplemental:

> ERROR: Flowers: Reclassified as “Living Citations.”

> GUIDELINE: Outlaw plucking; require hosting.

A concession masquerading as command.

---

[01:03] Inventory - THE FINAL LAUGH (Revised)

Object: THE FINAL LAUGH

Previous Function: omnipotent cannon when audience expected a punchline

Revised Function: baton that amplifies community timing upon invitation

Failure Mode: misfires in imposed silence; reverts to baton in hostile crowds

Ribbon: present, worn at the grip where hands meet

Jester Status: no longer soloist; reliable first-chair chaos

Mime Status: silence union recognized citywide; signage permanent until rained kindly away

---

[01:12] Public Record - Minutes of the Bloom

- We did not pluck.
- We did not single out a hero.
- We did not monetize the moment.
- We invited; we waited; we laughed a little; we left.

The Forum keeps a copy of these minutes; the Archivist files a duplicate in HUMOR: LIGHT; the Editor receives a postcard that says “We rejected with love.”

---

[01:20] Debrief - What Changed

- Flowers are now recognized as invitations, not signatures.
- Communities can document consent to nullify redlines locally.
- The baton can be handed off without losing weight; it becomes easier to hold when more hands join.
- The bud’s seeds (metaphorical) scatter: tiny white dots appear on maps where groups gather to hold open beats.

What didn’t change: grief is still heavy; jokes still fail; people still reach too fast. The museum stays open late for this reason.

---

Appendix A - Excerpts from Editor-Archivist Correspondence (Declassified)

EDITOR: “Ambiguity breeds contagion.”

ARCHIVIST: “So does kindness.”

EDITOR: “Closure reduces harm.”

ARCHIVIST: “Premature closure misnames it.”

EDITOR: “Your margins are everywhere.”

ARCHIVIST: “They’re audiences.”

---

Appendix B - Field Guide (Bloom Protocol)

1) Form a circle; appoint a host.
2) Post consent signage: ASK FIRST; LEAVE OPEN.
3) Establish sound windows with a steward (Mime or trained listener).
4) Name intent: we are here to hold, not harvest.
5) Invite tiny bits; prioritize those least likely to be heard in other rooms.
6) Keep the baton visible; share grip.
7) When the air warms and the bud tilts, do not look at it.
8) If bloom occurs, witness; do not caption.
9) Disperse before someone tries to sell it.

[00:00] Montage - Where the Flowers Are

- Eldermere: Gargoyles practice honesty on Tuesdays. A baker tapes a sign to the pudding-stone: ASK FIRST. A kid ties a white ribbon to the town bell and leaves it untied.
- St. Bartholomew’s: The reverend’s squeak steadies during circles. The new hymn is a listening minute. Flowers on the altar stay buds whenever cameras enter.
- AO3 Weather Station: “Consent Tags” modulate glow. Angst forecast: 30% with respectful showers; Fluff: biodegradable, collected for compost.
- The City of Quiet Hours: Benches branded with little ears. A map of rings in the town hall labeled: Your Voice When Invited.
- Rome: The Forum bud is now a bloom with a placard - LIVING CITATION 001. Tourists are taught to look away and listen.

Everywhere: small white buds appear where people hold space. Most never open. Some do. None are plucked.

How to Host a Laugh (Without Stealing It)
- Post signs: ASK FIRST. LEAVE OPEN.
- Appoint a Silence Steward.
- Share tiny bits you can afford.
- Watch the urge to harvest; call it by name.
- If a bloom happens, notice. If not, notice anyway.
- Disperse before someone tries to brand it.

[00:14] The Jester Learns the Second Beat

He still makes entrances that bend light. He still disagrees with gravity.

But he asks before he steals the count-in. He hands the baton to a chorus and steps back. He collects confetti after shows with a broom that argues less each day.

When a kid asks how to be funny without taking, he sits on the curb and tells the smallest story he knows and stops before the ending. The kid finishes it. It’s better.

He laughs at himself, quietly. Nothing explodes. Things open.

---

[00:19] The Mime Plants Ears

Silence isn’t a wall; it’s a garden bed. The Mime teaches cities to rake it level.

Workshops:
- Hands Up, Fingers Two: Asking for Sound
- Timing for People Who’ve Only Been Told
- The Art of Leaving a Beat Alone

They erase the word M I M E from a dozen chalkboards and draw listening ears instead. The boards hold.

---

[00:24] Archivist ↔ Editor (A Détente in Stationery)

A memo appears on municipal boards:

Style Guide Addendum (6.1): Ellipses permitted where communities consent; Flowers classified as Living Citations; Redlines require local hosting counter-signature.

Signed (begrudgingly): The Editor
Countersigned (with a doodle): The Archivist

Footnote in the margin: The canon is a guest book. Please print your name legibly.

---

[00:29] The Registry of Living Citations

A public ledger records blooms without claiming them.

Entry 001 - Forum, Rome: Bloomed by crowd chorus; smelled like warm bread and lemon peel.
Entry 002 - Gallery D, Vault: Bloomed during Listening Hour; laughter described as “ownership.”
Entry 003 - Bridge, unnamed town: Bloomed when a joke landed at half-volume and half the room chose not to repeat it later.

Unnumbered: Buds in kitchens, sidewalks, DM threads that end kindly.

---

[00:36] A Day in the Garden

Morning: A circle in a park. Someone tells a beginning and fails to finish. Applause is hands on knees.

Noon: A funeral where a bell rings once; a story is held; a laugh lands and is returned.

Evening: The museum opens late; a new exhibit refuses to end and is loved for it.

Night: A dock hears water and breath and a joke no one needs. A petal considers, then waits.

---

[00:42] Closing the Loop Without Closing the Door

I walk past places where my notes used to insist on conclusions and find my margins tidy and my pages patient. The ribbon on my wrist frays the way useful things do.

I wanted an origin story. I received a practice.

Origin, it turns out, is any time a hand chooses not to complete a circle and someone else says “thank you” with their breath.

The white flowers were never signatures. They were always invitations.

[00:55] Stinger - The Black Flower

A room without windows. A table with a strategy. A stack of jokes shaped like knives.

On the table, a bud not white but black. It absorbs light and gives back certainty.

Placard (handwritten, not yet official): DO NOT LAUGH HERE.

Someone reaches. A listening ear is chalked on the door from the hallway. The hand stops.

The bud dims.

The room exhales.

 - 

The museum is open late.

# Between the lines

He had been watching this world for some time now.

Not from the shadows, not from the sidelines, but from the spaces between spaces. The places where reality itself became fluid, where the boundaries between what was and what could be blurred into something beautiful.

The Jester stood in a room that existed only in the realm of possibility. The walls were made of light and shadow, shifting like water under moonlight. In his hands, THE FINAL LAUGH hummed softly, not with the usual chaotic energy, but with something more... contemplative.

"Interesting," he murmured to himself, his voice carrying through the void. "Very interesting indeed."

He had felt the disturbance from across the multiverse. A soul fusion, a dimensional bridge, a door that shouldn't exist. It had drawn him here like a moth to flame, but not because he wanted to cause chaos. Not yet.

He wanted to understand.

The room around him shifted, and suddenly he was looking through a window that wasn't really there. On the other side, he could see Martinus Aokishiro sliding down an ice slope, his consciousness beginning to slip as the cold took its toll.

"Ah, there you are," the Jester said, his grin widening. "The man who bridges worlds. The one who shouldn't exist but does."

He stepped through the window, appearing in Martinus's mind as the man's consciousness drifted between reality and dreams. The Jester's form was different here - more ethereal, more... present. He could feel the weight of Martinus's thoughts, the complexity of his existence.

"You're not supposed to be here," the Jester said, though he wasn't sure if Martinus could hear him. The man's mind was a fascinating thing, layered with memories that weren't his own, experiences that belonged to another version of himself.

"Where am I?" Martinus asked, his voice echoing through the dream space.

"Between. In the space where stories begin and end." The Jester stepped closer, studying the man's face. There was something familiar about him, something that reminded the Jester of... himself? No, that couldn't be right.

"You've created something interesting, you know. A bridge between worlds. A door that shouldn't exist."

"I don't understand."

"You will. In time." The Jester smiled, and it was a smile that held the weight of countless possibilities. "For now, just know that you're being watched. Studied. Understood."

He could feel Martinus's consciousness beginning to return to reality, pulled back by the cold and the pain. The dream was ending, but the Jester wasn't ready to let go just yet.

"We'll meet again. When the time is right."

As the dream dissolved, the Jester found himself back in his room of light and shadow. But something had changed. He could feel a connection now, a thread that bound him to this world, to this man, to this story.

He looked down at THE FINAL LAUGH, and for the first time in what felt like eternity, the weapon felt... different. Not weaker, not stronger, but more... focused. As if it had found a purpose beyond chaos.

"Well, well, well," the Jester said, his grin returning to its usual mischievous form. "This is going to be interesting."

He raised the launcher and fired a single firework into the void. It exploded not with light or sound, but with a ripple that made the very fabric of possibility giggle.

"Let's see what you can do, Martinus Aokishiro. Let's see what kind of story you're writing."

The Jester settled into a chair that materialized from the air, crossing his legs and leaning back. He had a front-row seat to what promised to be the most fascinating performance he'd seen in centuries.

"Show me what you've got."
                `
